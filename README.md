# Movies Correlation Analysis
Welcome to the repository for the Movie Correlation Data Analysis project! 
In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of movies dataset using Python for data exploration, data cleaning, and data analysis, and Tableau for data visualization. 
This repository serves as a resource for exploring the project's code, data, and findings.

### About the dataset
There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, 1986-2016). Each movie has the following attributes:
- budget: the budget of a movie. Some movies don't have this, so it appears as 0
- company: the production company
- country: country of origin
- director: the director
- genre: main genre of the movie.
- gross: revenue of the movie
- name: name of the movie
- rating: rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)
- released: release date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- runtime: duration of the movie
- score: IMDb user rating
- votes: number of user votes
- star: main actor/actress
- writer: writer of the movie

- year: year of release
